•	Idea: if you wish to spend $2000 USD in Korea, then we can show them KRW equivalent to spending $2000, which does not equate to exactly $2000 
•	PPP reflective travel budget planner 
•	Naming: money-related, travel/trip, accuracy 
•	Motivation: currency exchange of excess amount of money loses money for no reason. To minimize such tautological expenses, we developed this app. As a developer, we want a travel budget planner that gives us insight into how much we should actually bring. 
•	Slogan: Don’t carry too much. Travel with just about right budget

Process index with inserted value
