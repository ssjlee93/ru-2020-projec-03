# Proposal 
Original proposal of this proj…ôct

## Pocket Money

This full-stack application allows users to create, read, update, and delete an travel budget.
This budget calculator translates one currency into another currency with respect to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). For example, if a rich American carries $5000 USD to travel to Korea for 3 days, then he/she may not spend anywhere close to $5000 because the purchasing power of $5000 USD is higher than KRW. AS a traveller, he/she WANTS to exchange just about the right amount of money instead of exchange a lot more surplus and waste money through the exchange. 
* Target of this project is TripAdvisor or its alternatives. 
* Value of this project is its accuracy and efficiency. As an add-on to trip planning welbsites, this calculaator helps users plan and carry more accurate amount of money than planned. 
* Revenue model of this project comes from selling the API and receiving money with respect to API calls hit. Selling to hotels, travel agencies, and travel related websites will generate static revenue.
